column header name, used or not used, what it is used fordictionarySeq, used, sorting the order of tags to get the correct order to put out NMR-STAR file tags when writing out the files.originalCategory, used, for matching against the saveframe category tag in NMR-STAR files.aditCatManFlg, used, ADIT-NMR uses it to decide if the table should appear in the interface (N and Y = appear; H = hidden).aditCatViewType, used, ADIT-NMR uses it to decide how to present the table (vertical list or horizontal) aditSuperCatID, used, ADIT-NMR uses it for the tree menu grouping.aditSuperCatName, used, ADIT-NMR uses it for the tree menu grouping.aditCatGrpID, used, defines the saveframeaditCatViewName, used, defines the saveframeaditInitialRows, used, If it's a loop tag then ADIT-NMR uses it to decide how many rows initially to show in the table.  If it's free tags it's not meaningful.originalTag, used, Full name of the tag - used by many applications.aditExists, used," A flag to decide whether or not this tag will be mapped to ADIT-NMR's cif-like dictionary for NMRIF.  (If ""N"" then ADIT-NMR has no idea that it even exists.)"aditViewFlgs, used, A packed character array showing the mandatory view code for 6 different potential views.  As far as I can tell I'm only using the first character of this (dimitri might use more).  Originally we had once thought of using one of the other characters to represent an annotator view but I don't think that ever happened.enumeratedFlg, used," if set to ""Y"" = this is a tag that will have an enumeration if you look over in the adit_enum_dtl and adit_enum_hdr tables."itemEnumClosedFlg, used," if set to ""Y"" = this is a tag that a write-in is not alowed for - one MUST pick one of the values from the enumeration list."aditItemViewName, used, A human-readable version of the tag name for display in ADIT-NMR. (NOTE: IF THE _Adit_item_view_name tag exists in the adit_interface_dict.txt file it will overwrite this.)aditFormCode, used, Number that defines the type of input field used in ADIT-NMR (text vs select list vs radio button vs multi-line text box ...)dbType, used, SQL database type (Not used by ADIT-NMR but used by NMRIF/NMRSTAR conversion)bmrbType, used, higher-level data type (Elsewhere in another file this points to a regular expression defining what types of character patterns are allowed.)dbNullable, used," if ""NOT NULL"" then SQL thinks this field is mandatory (which is different from the validator thinking it's mandatory - if SQL thinks its mandatory then it's physically impossible to store the row in the database if this is missing.)"internalFlg, used," If ""Y"" then this tag is not supposed to be shown when exporting data to the public.  (for example a contact person's e-mail address)."rowIndexFlg, used," If ""Y"" then this is the tag that sequentially increments to count the rows of a loop and therefore should be re-numbered starting at 1."lclIDFlg, used," If ""Y"" then this tag is the ID uniquely identifying this instance of this tag category (row within saveframe if it's a loop or saveframe within file if it's a free-tag category)."lclSfIdFlg, used," If ""Y"" then this is the tag that refers to the Sf_ID for this saveframe."sfIdFlg, used," If ""Y"" then this tag is the one to be used as a reference to copy from when building the Sf_ID's later.  (Sf_ID's are populated automatically by looking at this tag as a guide)."sfLabelFlg, used," If ""Y"" then this tag is the one that holds the saveframe name. (if its value was ""abcd"" then the saveframe would be called ""save_abcd"")"sfCategoryFlg, used," If ""Y"" then this tag is the one that holds the saveframe category string."sfFramecodeFlg, NOT used," OBSOLETED: Use bmrbType instead to get the same information (whether or not this tag is meant to have a framecode ""$"" marker.)"primaryKey, used," If ""Y"" then this tag should be flagged as primary key when writing out the SQL create table statement."foreignKeyGroup, NOT used, (Obsoleted - leaving blank)foreignTable, used, Points to another table that this value can be looked-up on (but is not necessarily pointing to the primary key of that table and therefore this is not necessarily a foreign key.) The name with underscores is what's used.foreignColumn, used, Points to another column on another table that this value can be looked-up on (but is not necessarily pointing to the primary key of that table and therefore this is not necessarily a foreign key.) The name with underscores is what's used.indexFlg, used," If ""Y"" then a secondary index is attached to this column of the database - to speed up searches on this column."dbTableName, used, The name of the table in the database (usually just the category name with underscores removed) TODO - should we stop using this?dbColumnName, used, The name of the column in the database (usually just the tag name after the dot with underscores removed) TODO - should we stop using this?tagCategory, used, like dbTableName but with the underscores still intact - used for the NMRIF version of the table names.tagField, used, like dbColumnName but with the underscores still intact - used for the NMRIF version of the column names.loopFlg, used," If ""Y"" then this block of tags is a loop category otherwise its a free-tags category."seq, used, Sorts the tags within the tag category.  Technically we could redesign things to avoid using it since it's always the same sort order as the dictionarySeq.dbFlg, used," Similar to the aditExists flag but for the database.  If it's not set to ""Y"" then this tag won't exist in database representations."validateFlgs, used,"similar to AditViewFlgs, a 6-character array showing mandatory code for 6 different potential modes. 1st 2 modes are used: “internal” (i.e. annotators processing) and “public” (released)."valOverideFlgs, NOT used,Obsolete: this information is in a separate file: adit_tag_validation.csvdefaultValue, used, The default value for new rows/saveframes the user creates.  (And the value it starts with.)bmrbPdbMatchId, used, part of the mapping scheme to PDBX (paired with the nmr_cif_match file).bmrbPdbTransFunc, used, part of the mapping scheme to PDBX (paired with the nmr_cif_match file).variableTypeMatch, used, part of the mapping scheme to PDBX (paired with the nmr_cif_match file).entryIdFlg, used," If set to ""Y"" then this is the tag that (in NMRIF and database representations) ties this row of data to the entry it came from."OutputMapExistsFlg, used," (If not set then act like it's ""Y"" by default)  IF set to ""N"" then this mapping will not be performed when doing PDBX/NMRIF conversion.  Used as a way to ""comment out"" mappings without having to delete them from the dictionary."aditAutoInsert, used," Y/N If ""Y"" then this tag is marked as one that can be safely regenerated because it was automatically generated and is not user's input.  (NOTE: This was previously a numbered code that gave additional information but that information is in other flags now.)"datumCountFlgs, used," If set to a nonblank string then when calculating the values for that particular summary data count the number of rows in the database counting this tag is what we fill it with.  (i.e. ""select count(ID) from T1Rho;"" is what goes into the count of t1rho_relaxation_values)"metaDataFlgs, used, currently validator does not load large data tables into backend storage. Only tags where this flag is yes are loaded.tagDeleteFlgs, used,"overrides the “always print all loop columns” rule: where this is yes, loop column isn't printed."RefKeyGroup, used, Defines that this tag is part of a foreign key pointing at another table.  (All keys with the same ID here are part of the same combined key.)RefTable, used, Defines which table this tag is pointing at when it's part of a foreign key group.RefColum, used, Defines which column this tag is pointing at when it's part of a foreign key group.example, used, Gives an example value for this tag - for use in generating help text.  (NOTE: This is overridden by whatever is in adit_interface_dict.txt)
