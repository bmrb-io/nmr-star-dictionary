# The majority of the following item type definitions and descriptions for units
# have been taken from the pdbx and mmCIF dictionaries.

# The NMR-STAR dictionary has been constructed to be congruent with the pdbx
# where the data being modeled are equivalent. In these cases, where possible
# identical items have been used and the definitions for these items are
# intended to be identical.
