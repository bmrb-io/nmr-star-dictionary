# The majority of the following item type definitions and descriptions for units
# have been taken from the pdbx and mmCIF dictionaries.

# The NMR-STAR dictionary has been constructed to be congruent with the pdbx
# where the data being modeled are equivalent. In these cases, where possible
# identical items have been used and the definitions for these items are
# intended to be identical.

;              symop item types take the form n_klm, where n refers to the
               symmetry operation that is applied to the coordinates in the
               ATOM_SITE category identified by _atom_site_label.  It must
               match a number given in _symmetry_equiv_pos_site_id.

               k, l, and m refer to the translations that are subsequently
               applied to the symmetry transformed coordinates to generate
               the atom used.  These translations (x,y,z) are related to
               (k,l,m) by
                     k = 5 + x
                     l = 5 + y
                     m = 5 + z
               By adding 5 to the translations, the use of negative numbers
               is avoided.

 Depositors are required to provide a value for this field.  If the data in

depositor truly does not know the journal a value of 'not known' is acceptable.
